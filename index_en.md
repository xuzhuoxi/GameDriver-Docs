## What is GameDriver Pro
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.  

### Easy to install and publish
Get started by cloning source into GitHub account of your project. Thanks to GitHub Pages, it will be automatically compiled and published under your account's (or organisation's) subdomain under github.io.  

### Modular Styling and Templating
This template uses bootstrap-sass along with Bootwatch themes. You can change the theme or write your custom one by overwriting bootstrap sass variables for a different color set, font options, etc.  

### Git-based source control
Leverage from Git version control system by maintaining your documentation along with the source code; publish the page when you merge to the master branch.
